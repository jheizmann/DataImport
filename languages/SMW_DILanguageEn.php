Each parameter is addressed by a unique path within the type hierarchy. You can browse the type hierarchy by expanding respectively collapsing the subtypes in the tree view. For each parameter you wish to use, you have to specify an alias which you can later use to address the parameter. If you do not want to use a parameter for the method call, you have to leave the corresponding alias input field empty. If you like to save time you can press the pencil icon in the head of the alias column for automatic alias generation. You also can specify if a parameter will be optional when you later will call the Web Service. At last you have the possibility to define a default value for a parameter which will be used for the Web Service call in case you do not provide a value for the parameter.',

	'smw_wws_s5-help' => '<h4>Help</h4>The update policies define the time period after which a value delivered by a Web Service will be updated. The display policy will be relevant whenever a value is displayed in an article, whereas the query policy is only relevant for semantic queries. The delay value (in seconds) is applied between two calls of a Web Service. So you can prevent, that the service is called too often in a short time, which may violate the terms of use of the web service provider. The span of life defines how long a result of a Web Service call will be kept in the cache. If you do not provide a value for the span of life, then the value will be kept in the cache for an unlimited time span. At last you can choose if the age of cached results will be reset if they are updated or after their last access (e.g. by viewing an article). ',
