	CHANGES:
	* The Wiki Web Service Definition (WWSD) syntax originally accepted more than one usage of the '<result>' tag, which enabled users to group result parts. This is still allowed, but a warning will appear if you use such a construct, because the new Data Import extension features do not support that construct anymore and errors are possible.

	BUGFIXES:
	* Nothing special to report.
