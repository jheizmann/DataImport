Installation instructions
-------------------------

Requirements: 
    MediaWiki 1.13 or higher
    SMW 1.4.2 
    Halo extension 1.4.3
    Semantic Gardening extension 1.0
	

1) Add to your LocalSettings.php: (After the Halo and the 
Semantic Gardening extensions were initialised)
---
include_once('extensions/DataImport/includes/DI_Initialize.php');
enableDataImportExtension();
---

2) Login as WikiSysop, go to the special page "Special:SMWAdmin" and 
run the "Initialise or update tables" script.

3) That's it.

Notice: If you already used a prior version of the Web Service extension, 
then you have to replace the dots in the path-attributes of your existing
WWSDs by slashes, so that the paths are conform to the XPath syntax.
