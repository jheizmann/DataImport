The easiest way to install ASF is using the deployment framework:

	smwadmin -i dataimport

That's it.


If you want to install Data Import manually, then do the following:

(1) Extract the DataImport folder into the extension directory of MediaWiki

(2) Add to your LocalSettings.php: (After the Halo and the 
Semantic Gardening extensions were initialized)
	
	include_once('extensions/DataImport/includes/DI_Initialize.php');
	enableDataImportExtension();
	
(3) Login as WikiSysop, go to the special page "Special:SMWAdmin" and 
run the "Initialize or update tables" script. (please do that also if you are
updating the Data Import extension.)

(4)) That's it.


Install the Inter Wiki Article Importer (Optional)
=============

(1) Add the following two lines to your LocalSettings.php (After Data Import has been initialized.)

	include_once('extensions/DataImport/IAI/includes/IAI_Initialize.php');
	enableIAI();
